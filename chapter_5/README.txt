What I learned:
    - Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as
    arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
    
    - JavaScript functions have an 'apply' method.
    You pass it an array (or array-like object) of arguments, and it will call
    the function with those arguments.
