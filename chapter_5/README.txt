What I learned:
    + Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as
    arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
    + JavaScript functions have an 'apply' method.
    You pass it an array (or array-like object) of arguments, and it will call
    the function with those arguments.
    + JSON rules: All property names have to be surrounded
    by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowedâ€”no
    function calls, variables, or anything that involves actual computation.
    Comments are not allowed in JSON.
    + Standard higher-order functions on arrays: filter, map, reduce.
    + The bind method, which all functions have, creates a new function that
    will call the original function but with some of the arguments already
    fixed.
    + Array method concat() is analogous to concatenation method on strings, it returns new array 
    because function is pure.
    + Every variable has method type() which returns it's type.
