What I learned:
	+ Function can be treated as a variable value.
	+ Function without return statement returns undefined value.
	+ Variables declared inside of function are local and variables declared outside of function are global.
	+ Functions are the only things that create a new scope, free-standing blocks doesn't create new scopes.
	+ let keyword creates variable that is local to the enclosing block, not the enclosing function.
	+ Function declarations are conceptually moved to the top of their and can be used by all the code in that scope.
	+ If there are too few arguments for function,parameters not specified will have value undefined, with too many extra ones will be ignored.
	+ Closure is the feature that allows enclosing function to reference specific instances of local variables.
