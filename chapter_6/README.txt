What I learned:
    + The idea is that the interface is relatively simple and all the complex things
    going on inside the object can be ignored when working with it.
    + Methods are simply properties that hold function values.
    + When a function is called as a method the special variable this in
    its body will point to the object that it was called on.
    + 'apply', 'call' and 'bind' are methods that functions have, that means function is treated as object.
