What I learned:
	- Indexing array with negative numbers, or numbers bigger than array size
	returns undefined value.
	- Array has push,pop methods and length property.
	- Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties, and
	we can add or remove these properties as we please.
	- If we try to access property that object doesn't have, undefined value is
	returned.
	- Object properties are written in JSON(Java Script Object Notation) format.
	- Properties whose names are not valid variable names or valid numbers
	have to be quoted.
	- The binary in operator, when applied to a string and an object, returns a
	Boolean value that indicates whether that object has that property.
	- Arrays are just a kind of object specialized for storing sequences
	of things.
	- If property names are numbers you must use operator [] instead object_name.property_name.
	- To access property with operator [] you must type object_name["property_name"], numbers are
	exceptions, example: myObject[1], myObject["name"].
	- Numbers,strings and Booleans are immutable.
