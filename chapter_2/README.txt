What I learned:
	+ Variables "var" similair as Java references, they refer(point) to value.
	+ Variables are not tied to certain type, same variable refering to value of
	one type can be used to refer to value of the different type.
	+ Variables that aren't initialized have "undefined" value.
	+ Variables can be declared without "var" keyword.
	+ Enviroment by default contains variables and functions defined by language and variables
	and functions related to browser.
	+ Type names start with big letters.
	+ Number function returns NaN if argument was not number.
